# File permission
- Owner permissions − The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.

- Group permissions − The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.

- Other (world) permissions − The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.
- 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute) = 7
